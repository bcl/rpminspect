# only list individual words and not phrases as the test is meant to
# capture substrings for instances where some care needs to be taken for
# phrasing or name abbreviations.

# value is the JVM major version.  For example:
#     fc30 = 53
# You should also always specify a default, like this:
#     default = 53

# use the default entry.  You can have as many entries as you want in
