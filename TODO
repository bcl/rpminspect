| rpminspect and librpminspect |
+==============================+

The tests below are the categories handled by rpmdiff-checker.  You
may recognize these as the grid categories on the rpmdiff webui.  Each
test category may perform a couple of tests.  For example,
TEST_PATCHES contains both tests for the patches in an SRPM as well as
the License: tag.  Some tests may do something else that pertains to
the License: tag check.  The point is, as we iterate through each of
the test categories, we can refactor things and group them together as
new single tests exposed through rpminspect which rpmdiff-checker can
continue working as it always have.

The code for these test categories can be found in src/checker/src/.
To see how some have moved over to librpminspect, see completed tests
as indicated below.

* indicates the logic for the tests has moved to librpminspect
! means the work is in-progress


Mandatory test categories to migrate (top is highest priority):
---------------------------------------------------------------
 TEST_ABI
 TEST_FILEMOVE
 TEST_PATHNAMES
 TEST_CONFIG
 TEST_MODPARM
 TEST_MODPCIID
!TEST_SIZE (need to support size inc/dec thresholds for reporting)
 TEST_PERMS
 TEST_CHANGELOG
 TEST_MULTILIB


Unranked tests categories to migrate (might also decide to skip them):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
!TEST_METADATA
    need to get the fedora_without_redhat test implemented from checker
!TEST_PATCHES
    completed License tag test (as INSPECT_LICENSE)
 TEST_POLITICS
 TEST_REQUIRES
 TEST_RPATH
 TEST_RPMCHANGE
 TEST_SCRIPT
 TEST_SPECFILE
*   dist tag check from rpmpatches.c (this is 'disttag' in rpminspect)
*   license check from rpmpatches.c (this is 'license' in rpminspect)
 TEST_STRIP
 TEST_SYMLINK
 TEST_TRIGGERS
 TEST_TYPES
 TEST_VIRUS


Questions:
    - Check for strings and filenames with 'fedora' without mention of
      'redhat'?  I say no because it's subjective and seems pointless.

    - Do we need the politics check?  All it does is look for image
      files that contain 'taiwan' in the filename.  If they are not on
      the taiwan_flag_whitelist, they raise a VERIFY result that
      anyone can waive.


Test categories that have been migrated:
----------------------------------------
*TEST_CHANGED (this is changedfiles in rpminspect)
*TEST_DESKTOP
*TEST_EMPTYRPM
*TEST_FILELIST (this is addedfiles and removedfiles in rpminspect)
*TEST_JAVABYTECODE
*TEST_MANPAGE
*TEST_OWNERSHIP
*TEST_SHELLSYNTAX
*TEST_XML
*TEST_IPV6 (part of elf inspection in rpminspect)
*TEST_EXECSHIELD (this is elf in rpminspect)
*TEST_NEEDED (this is DT_NEEDED in rpminspect)
*TEST_UPSTREAM (the BZ 'Rebase' keyword check against the Errata Tool
                bug list was not migrated, see below)


Test categories excluded (see MISSING):
---------------------------------------
 TEST_BUILDLOG
 TEST_RPMLINT
 TEST_UPSTREAM (only the rebase keyword check)
 TEST_ELFLINT

Integration tests to write for rpminspect
-----------------------------------------

The test suite needs more integration tests written.  The following
inspections lack integration tests:

    modularity
    javabytecode
    changedfiles (compare only)
    removedfiles (compare only)
    addedfiles (compare only)
    upstream (compare only)
    ownership
    shellsyntax
    annocheck
    DT_NEEDED
    filesize
