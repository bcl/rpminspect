regress/

The scripts found in this directory are used periodically to perform
long tests.  They are not guaranteed to always work since each time
they are used they may require some tweaking.  All of the scripts use
$RPMINSPECT from the environment as the command to run for rpminspect.
If that is not set in the calling environment, it defaults to
'rpminspect'.  The script does not try to use the built rpminspect in
the source tree.

SCRIPTS IN THIS DIRECTORY:

indiv-inspections-kernel.sh
    Run an rpminspect comparison against the two most recent COMPLETE
    kernel builds in the most recent Fedora tag in Koji.  Each
    inspection is run separately, timed, and stdout/stderr combined in
    to a log file in this directory.

    Purpose: To see that each inspection runs without crashing for
    kernel comparisons as well as getting a ballpark figure on typical
    execution time for each inspection during kernel comparisons.
