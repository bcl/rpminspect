rpminspect can be considered a descendant of Red Hat's internal
rpmdiff tool.  The spirit of rpmdiff lives on in rpminspect.

rpmdiff (the internal one at Red Hat) performed a number of tests on a
set of packages and reported the results.  These test categories live
on in spirit in the form of rpminspect's inspections.  rpminspect
takes a different approach to test categorization and focuses on a
generic implementation that can be customized per product, whereas
rpmdiff was developed specifically for Red Hat's process.

Those familiar with Red Hat's rpmdiff may notice some test categories
are missing from rpminspect.  Here is a list of deliberate exclusions
from the design of rpminspect:

    Build Log
        Look at build log output from rpmbuild(1) and look for common
        compiler error or warning substrings and report those to
        users.  This is not in rpminspect because it feels out of
        scope for the tool.  Checking build logs and compiler output
        should be the job of another dedicated tool, the build process
        itself, or the project's test suite.  rpminspect is about
        validating the built artifacts for policy compliance.

    rpmlint
        The rpmdiff tool would invoke rpmlint(1) on each package and
        collect the results for reporting.  This is unnecessary as
        rpmlint can be run by itself and results collected separately.
