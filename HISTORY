rpminspect can be considered a descendant of Red Hat's internal
rpmdiff tool.  The spirit of rpmdiff lives on in rpminspect.

rpmdiff (the internal one at Red Hat) performed a number of tests on a
set of packages and reported the results.  These test categories live
on in spirit in the form of rpminspect's inspections.  rpminspect
takes a different approach to test categorization and focuses on a
generic implementation that can be customized per product, whereas
rpmdiff was developed specifically for Red Hat's process.

Those familiar with Red Hat's rpmdiff may notice some test categories
are missing from rpminspect.  See the MISSING file for more
information.

Another thing worth noting is that rpminspect is a tool and not a
service.  rpmdiff was primarily a service that users submitted jobs to
and results were reported.  There were a set of tools underneath that
you could run on your development system, but it was not easy to
construct the same execution environment.  Most developers never
bothered running the tools locally.  rpminspect is a developer tool
first, so running it as part of a development or build process is key.
The tool can be integrated in to different continuous integration
systems to get the same type of service that rpmdiff used to provide.
